## Hosting Details

### Hosting Platform: **Replit**
The bot is hosted on Replit, an online IDE and hosting platform. Replit was chosen for the following reasons:

   - Replit offers free hosting for small-scale projects, making it ideal for this test assignment.
   - Other hosting platforms like AWS, Google colab, or Heroku can incur significant costs, especially for long-running bots or projects with limited budgets.
   - Replit provides an intuitive interface for writing, running, and debugging Python code directly in the browser. This makes it convenient for quick assignments or small-scale projects.
   - Built-in support for environment variables simplifies secure token management.
   - While the free version of Replit may not keep the bot running 24/7, upgrading to a paid plan is still more affordable compared to other platforms.

   - Add a new variable named `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and paste your bot token as the value.
4. Click **Run** to start the bot. Replit will automatically host the bot and make it accessible to your Discord server.
